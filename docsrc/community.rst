Questions that help discover bugs should lead to the creation of bug reports in the GitHub issue tracker.

GitHub
------

The `GeoNetwork GitHub issues tracker <https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/issues>`_ is where all bug reports
and feature requests should be done.

There are templates for both uses that *needs to be followed* in order to facilitate
reproduction (for bugs) or assessment (for features).

Please note that anyone creating an issue is considered responsible for maintaining activity
on it, at least while no contributor has been specifically assigned to it. 
This can for example be done by pinging community members, providing additional information or
suggesting fixes.

Issues with no activity in the last 6 months will be automatically closed.
If an issue is really important to you, please help us look for funding to work on it.
