Gitter
------

GeoNetwork has a gitter channel https://gitter.im/geonetwork/core-geonetwork that you can join.

Chat can be very useful for one-on-one collaboration, however due to timezone differences it is not always efficient for asking questions.

This channel replaces the previous IRC. For a history of previous activity on the IRC channel, search the `archives
<http://irclogs.geoapt.com/geonetwork/>`_.

StackExchange
-------------

`GIS StackExchange <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/geonetwork>`_ ask for GeoNetwork support using the ``geonetwork`` tag.

* List of recent questions: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/geonetwork
* List of unanswered questions: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/geonetwork?sort=unanswered

Questions that help discover bugs should lead to the creation of bug reports in the GitHub issue tracker.
